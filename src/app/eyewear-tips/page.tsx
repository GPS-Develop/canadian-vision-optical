      <ol>
        <li><b>Rinse Your Glasses First</b><br/>Gently rinse your lenses with lukewarm water to remove dust or particles. This prevents scratching during wiping.</li>
        <li><b>Apply Lens Cleaner or Soap</b><br/>Use one drop of dish soap or a lens-safe cleaner on each lens. Avoid anything scented or abrasive.</li>
        <li><b>Rub Gently with Your Fingers</b><br/>Lightly massage the lenses and frames. Don't forget the nose pads and temple arms!</li>
        <li><b>Rinse and Shake Dry</b><br/>Rinse again with water, then gently shake off excess droplets.</li>
        <li><b>Dry with a Microfiber Cloth</b><br/>Wipe using a clean, dry microfiber cloth. No pressure needed, just let the cloth do the work.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <h3>üß† Pro Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep a travel-size lens cleaner and cloth in your bag or car.</li>
        <li>Clean your glasses daily to avoid buildup.</li>
